# clickstream_sessionization
Created session logic using SQL for users in the TurboTax &amp; Quickbooks Live products

## Use Case
Users in these products are constantly going from one section of the product to the other. This behavior is tracked using clickstream, which produces hundreds of millions, and sometimes billions, of data points. The goal was to create a framework which tracks user behavior in a certain area of the product, and creates unique sessions for each interaction
